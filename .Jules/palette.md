## 2024-05-22 - Autocomplete and Input Modes
**Learning:** Form inputs often lack `autocomplete` attributes, forcing users to manually type data that browsers could autofill. Also, numeric inputs (like ZIP codes) benefit significantly from `inputmode="numeric"` on mobile devices.
**Action:** Always audit form inputs for `autocomplete` and appropriate `inputmode` attributes during UX review.
