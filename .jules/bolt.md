## 2025-02-18 - Scroll Performance Optimization
**Learning:** Found a scroll handler in `src/routes/+page.svelte` that triggers reflows (reading `offsetHeight`) and runs synchronously on every scroll event without `passive: true`. This can cause significant jank, especially on mobile devices where the "hero" section is prominent.
**Action:** Decoupling scroll logic using `requestAnimationFrame`, caching layout values, and using passive listeners is a standard pattern that should be applied to all scroll-dependent effects.
