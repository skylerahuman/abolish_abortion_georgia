## 2024-05-17 - Form Autocomplete Attributes
**Learning:** Adding standard HTML `autocomplete` attributes (like `given-name`, `family-name`, `email`, `street-address`, `address-level2`, `tel`) is a simple yet powerful micro-UX improvement. It drastically improves form completion speed and accessibility for users who rely on password managers or browser autofill.
**Action:** Always verify that input fields in forms have the appropriate `autocomplete` attributes set to improve accessibility and user experience.
