# Local development and deployment

Repository: `skylerahuman/abolish_abortion_georgia` (underscores).

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1
npm run build
```

Node 22 is used locally and in CI. No secrets are needed to build. Optionally set
`DATABASE_URL` in a local `.env` for volunteer registration; without it that API
returns 503 and does not store submissions. No production database is configured.

## Branches

- `dev`: the full existing SvelteKit application at https://dev.endabortionga.org.
- `prd`: production, initially only `deploy/holding/` at https://endabortionga.org.
- `main`: preserved historical branch; currently still the GitHub default branch.

**Bootstrap blocker:** the PAT lacks Administration: write. GitHub returned 403
for protections, rulesets and changing the default branch. Neither branch is
protected yet. Automatic production promotion is therefore disabled on the VM;
production serves a locally seeded copy of the reviewed holding page.

Grant the PAT repository Administration: write, then run:

```sh
node deploy/configure-github.mjs
# Only after that command succeeds:
sudo touch /var/lib/eag-deploy-secrets/production-enabled
sudo systemctl start eag-deploy.service
```

That command makes `prd` the default and applies two independent policies: PRs
and the `build` check are mandatory even for administrators, while only the
repository administrator (currently skylerahuman alone) bypasses the restriction
on updating prd. Do not grant other people administrator access. Force pushes and
branch deletion are blocked. No automation merges production PRs. Initial branch
bootstrap precedes protection.

After protections are configured, push work to dev or open a feature PR into dev.
Promote by opening a PR **from dev into prd**.

## Build and deployment

GitHub-hosted runners build on dev/prd pushes and PRs. The required `build` job
checks the production PR source, builds SvelteKit and smoke-tests its HTTP server
and the unavailable database response. The old unit suite runs non-blocking:
at bootstrap 6 tests fail (stale navigation expectations and missing browser
IntersectionObserver mock). `npm run check` also has an existing undefined
`sectionLines` error in georgia-battle. These are not silently considered passing;
repair them and make those checks blocking before the full public-site launch.
Existing third-party dependency audit findings also need a separate review.

Push builds upload `site-dev` / `site-prd` artifacts. Production artifacts contain
only the holding page, never the full application. Changing production to the
full site requires an explicit change to the package step, host routing and
reviewed production service configuration, promoted through a dev-to-prd PR.

The VM polls once per minute, selects a successful run of `tests.yml` from this
repository and the exact current branch HEAD, checks the artifact SHA-256 digest,
and safely extracts only regular files/directories. It does not execute package
scripts or artifact deployment scripts. Releases are root-owned and switched by
atomic symlink. Dev runs as the unprivileged eag-preview user with a health check
and automatic rollback on failure. PR builds never deploy.

The PAT is held only in a root-only systemd credential source, never in GitHub
Actions, git, logs or command arguments. The runner never receives VM credentials.
The host puller is installed independently at `/opt/eag-deploy/pull-release.py`;
repository changes do not auto-update it. Host configuration is in
`/home/sky/oci-dev-nixos/eag-cicd.nix` (a snapshot is in `deploy/eag-cicd.nix`).

```sh
sudo systemctl start eag-deploy.service
sudo journalctl -u eag-deploy.service -u eag-preview.service -n 50
sudo systemctl list-timers eag-deploy.timer
```

Current and previous releases are under `/var/lib/eag-releases/{dev,prd}/`.
To roll back manually, stop the deploy timer, atomically point `current` at the
`previous` release, and restart eag-preview for dev. Revert the offending commit
through the normal branch workflow before restarting the timer. Old releases are
retained; monitor disk usage and remove only unreferenced release directories.

## DNS and TLS

Point the apex `A` record to this VM; remove stale `AAAA` records unless IPv6 also
reaches this VM. Ports 80 and 443 must remain reachable. Caddy obtains and renews
TLS certificates automatically once DNS resolves correctly. Cloudflare DNS-only
mode is simplest for initial issuance; use Full (strict) if enabling its proxy.
The existing why.endabortionga.org backend and private admin/data remain untouched.
The dev host now serves this repository instead of the old EAG frontend.

## Credential rotation

Replace `/var/lib/eag-deploy-secrets/github-token` as root (mode 0600), then restart
the deploy service. The token needs repository Contents: read and Actions: read
for polling. Administrative API permissions needed to finish bootstrap are not needed
by the running puller; replace its credential with a least-privilege token when
convenient. Keep the production-enabled marker absent until protections succeed.
