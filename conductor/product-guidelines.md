# Product Guidelines - Abolition Georgia

## Brand Voice & Tone
*   **Serious & Authoritative:** The platform speaks with the weight of history, law, and scripture. Messaging should be direct, uncompromising, and urgent, avoiding "cutesy" or corporate-generic language.
*   **Legal & Theological:** Terminology should reflect the Abolitionist Standard (e.g., "equal protection," "interposition," "homicide statutes") rather than marketing jargon.

## Visual Identity
*   **Aesthetic:** A strategic blend of **Historical Authority** (evoking legal documents and historical abolitionism) and **Modern Advocacy** (mobile-first, fast information consumption).
*   **Typography:**
    *   **Headings:** Strong Serif fonts to convey authority and historical weight.
    *   **Body:** Clean Sans-Serif fonts to ensure readability and rapid scanning on mobile devices.
*   **Palette:**
    *   **Primary:** High-contrast Black (`#000`) and White (`#fff`).
    *   **Accent:** Bold Red (e.g., `#ef4444` or darker blood red) for calls to action and emphasis.
    *   **Secondary:** Cream/Off-white for softening long-form reading sections.
*   **Imagery:**
    *   **Symbolism:** Incorporation of abolitionist iconography (e.g., *The Liberator*, shackles breaking, scales of justice).
    *   **Background:** Use of a black background featuring an inverted Georgia skyline to ground the mission in its specific geography.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
*   **Mobile-First:** Prioritize touch targets, fast load times, and vertical scrolling flow, acknowledging that most mobilization happens on phones.
*   **Clarity over Flash:** Avoid excessive animations or decorative elements that distract from the core message or slow down the "Who Do I Call" workflow.
*   **Direct Action:** Every page should have a clear path to the primary goal: contacting a legislator or finding a local abolitionist community.
