# Product Guide - Abolition Georgia

## Initial Concept

This project is dedicated to the complete abolition of abortion in the state of Georgia. Our mission is to establish equal protection for all human beings, from the moment of fertilization to natural death, without exception or compromise.

## Vision & Purpose

The primary purpose of the Abolition Georgia platform is to secure the passage of **HB 441** in the 2026 legislative session. It serves as a mobilization and education hub to transform passive support into active political and spiritual pressure.

## Target Audience

- **Georgia Residents:** Voters who need to know who represents them and how to demand equal protection for the pre-born.
- **Churches & Pastors:** Local spiritual leaders looking to lead their congregations in abolitionist action and those seeking to join the cause.
- **Abolitionist Organizers:** Local societies and individuals coordinating mobilization efforts.
- **Educable Citizens:** Individuals seeking to understand the critical distinction between "pro-life" regulation and total abolition.
- **Out-of-State Supporters:** Individuals looking to support the Georgia project and learn from its model.

## Primary Goals

1.  **HB 441 Advocacy:** Drive the passage of HB 441 in the 2026 session by educating the public on its necessity and providing tools for direct action.
2.  **Mobilization:** Facilitate direct contact between Georgians and their state representatives/senators with clear, urgent scripts.
3.  **Historical Correction:** Provide a legislative and historical timeline that exposes the failures of incrementalism and charts the rise of the abolitionist movement.
4.  **Community Building:** Connect individuals with abolitionist-minded churches and societies to build a sustainable grassroots movement.

## Key Features

- **Research-Driven Home Page:** A high-impact landing page presenting the "State of Abortion in Georgia: 2024–2025" report, using real-world data to demonstrate the failure of regulatory restrictions.

## Success Metrics
