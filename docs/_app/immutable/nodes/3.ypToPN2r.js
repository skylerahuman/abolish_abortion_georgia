				<p>Christian abolitionism is the application of God's law and the Gospel to the sin of child sacrifice, demanding equal protection for preborn image-bearers as for the born.</p>
				<p>It means:</p>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
					<li>Equal protection under the 14th Amendment to the pre-born</li>
					<li>Criminalizing abortion as homicide with no arbitrary age limits</li>
					<li>No partiality based on location, age, or circumstances of conception</li>
					<li>Defining life from fertilization—not heartbeat, not viability</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Biblical foundation: Proverbs 24:11, Proverbs 31:8, James 2:1-9</p>
			`},{id:"what-is-pro-lifism",title:"What is Pro-Lifism?",content:`
				<p>The "pro-life" regulatory approach has dominated for 50 years:</p>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
					<li>Arbitrary lines: Protects life only after heartbeat, 15 weeks, or viability</li>
					<li>Immunity: Often grants immunity to mothers or providers in certain cases</li>
					<li>Subservient: Bows to federal court opinions rather than challenging them</li>
					<li>Incremental: Seeks small victories rather than complete justice</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Result: Decades of legislation, yet abortion continues.</p>
			`},{id:"why-equal-protection",title:"Why Equal Protection?",content:`
				<p>God's law demands equal weights and measures (Leviticus 19:35-36, Proverbs 20:10).</p>
				<p>If a preborn child is made in the image of God—and Scripture is clear that they are—then we must apply the same legal protection given to born persons.</p>
				<p>Equal protection means:</p>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
					<li>No exceptions for rape, incest, or "quality of life"</li>
					<li>The same homicide statutes that protect you protect your unborn neighbor</li>
					<li>Biblical consistency: "Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute" (Proverbs 31:8-9)</li>
				</ul>
			`},{id:"what-this-means-in-georgia",title:"What This Means in Georgia",content:`
				<p>Georgia has a heartbeat bill. It saves some lives. But it inherently denies personhood to children younger than ~6 weeks, leaving them without protection.</p>
				<p>The Georgia Equal Protection Act (HB 441) removes exceptions and establishes full equal protection—treating the pre-born with the exact same legal status as the born.</p>
