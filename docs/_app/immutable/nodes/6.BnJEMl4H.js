Thus, asking about rape and incest forces us to confront the reality that we object to violating another person's body. Violating the body of another is exactly what happens during an abortion and no child should be killed for the crime of the father.",sources:[{text:"Lozier Institute: Abortion Statistics",url:"https://lozierinstitute.org/abortion-reporting-rape-and-incest-exceptions/"},{text:"Guttmacher Institute",url:"https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2005/reasons-us-women-have-abortions-quantitative-and-qualitative-perspectives"}]},{question:'What about "my body, my choice"?',answer:"The body inside of the woman's body is not her body. If abortion was about the mother's body, then she would be the one that dies and not the baby!",sources:[{text:"10 Pro-Life Arguments",url:"https://prolifereplies.liveaction.org/"}]},{question:"What about the quality of life of the mother or child? Or poverty situations?",answer:"Abortion advocates often appeal to dire situations to make their case in order to tug at the heart. This argument is absurd. Should mothers and fathers be allowed to simply kill their children if times are tough?",sources:[{text:"10 Pro-Life Arguments",url:"https://prolifereplies.liveaction.org/"}]},{question:"What about contraceptives?",answer:"An equal protection bill does not ban contraceptives (i.e. drugs or devices to prevent fertilization). Instead, abortifacients are banned when used to knowingly and willfully cause the death of the child.",sources:[{text:"Foundation to Abolish Abortion",url:"https://faa.life/equal-protection"}]},{question:"Isn't a fetus only a cluster of cells?",answer:'All human life is made up clumps of cells. The Latin word "fetus" means "little one," referring to the relatively small size of the preborn baby. So, a baby is still a baby regardless of what we call them. It is biologically indisputable that a unique human life exists from the moment of fertilization.',sources:[{text:"NIH: The Biological Beginning of Human Life",url:"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245522/"},{text:'Etymology of "Fetus"',url:"https://www.etymonline.com/word/fetus"}]},{question:"What about ectopic pregnancies?",answer:`The National Health Service webpage dedicated to ectopic pregnancy information states, "The baby cannot be saved in an ectopic pregnancy." Almost all medical groups and government medical bureaucracies echo this malicious falsehood. The medical literature confirms that misdiagnosing ectopic pregnancy is quite common, and even if the diagnosis is accurate, there is much evidence that the tubal-implanted embryo can naturally detach and reattach in a safer location.

For example, a 1982 article by Dr. J. F. Clark entitled "Embryo Transfer In Vivo" demonstrated that, in a tubal pregnancy, the rupture of the fallopian tube does not kill the preborn child. In many cases, the child will detach from the ruptured tube on his own and reattach on another surface in the pelvis or abdominal cavity. This has made it possible for a significant number of tubal pregnancies to result in live births.`,sources:[{text:"J.F.
