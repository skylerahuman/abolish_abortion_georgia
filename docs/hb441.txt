to abort her child, and such provisions should be removed.27

believes that performing the act is the only way to prevent his imminent death or great34
bodily injury.35
(a) A person is not guilty of a crime if the act upon which the supposed criminal liability36
is based is performed under such coercion that the person reasonably believes that the37
performance of the act is the only way to prevent his or her imminent death or great bodily38
