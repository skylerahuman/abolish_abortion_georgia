					would cover the earth as the waters cover the sea. We are committed to informing,
					equipping and encouraging the Church that she might once again become faithful and fulfill
					her duty and privilege as soldier pilgrims, to take dominion for King Jesus."

		</div>

		<div class="space-y-8">
			<div>
				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-red-600">Our History</h2>
				<p>For nearly a decade, Operation Gospel has been preaching the Gospel faithfully to mothers heading into abortion clinics. We are now seeking to bring the Gospel to the voters of Georgia.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-red-600">Our Team</h2>
				<p>Operation Gospel is a team of pastors, evangelists, and everyday Christians who are committed to the abolition of abortion in Georgia. We are a grassroots organization that is funded by the faithful support of individuals and churches who believe that the Gospel must be preached at the gates of hell.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-red-600">Our Theological Stance</h2>
				<p>We are an explicitly Christian, Reformed, postmillennial, abolitionist ministry. We believe that the Bible is the inspired and inerrant Word of God, and that it is the final authority for all matters of faith and life. We believe that the Great Commission requires us to make disciples of all nations, and that this includes calling our civil magistrates to repent and to establish justice for the pre-born.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-red-600">Our Partners</h2>
				<p>We collaborate with Georgia Life Alliance (GLA) and the Georgia Baptist Association. We are not affiliated with Georgia Right to Life.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-red-600">Our National Context</h2>
				<p>Operation Gospel is part of a growing movement of abolitionist societies across the nation. We are thankful for the work of organizations like Free the States, End Abortion Now, and the Foundation to Abolish Abortion, and we are proud to stand with them in the fight to end abortion in our lifetime.</p>
